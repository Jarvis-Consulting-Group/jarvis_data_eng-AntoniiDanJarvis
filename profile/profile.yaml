# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a qualified software engineer with three years of back-end development and infrastructure creation experience at two huge tech companies. Gained back-end developer expertise by developing Java Spring Boot microservices and covered them with the unit, integration and contract tests following the TDD approach. Acquired a vast range of infrastructure skills by participating in extensive infrastructure improvement projects like pipeline creation, monitoring integration, AWS migration etc. Additionally I have an an expertise in such complex domains as ad-tech and game-dev along with computer engineer bachelor's degree.

    description: Developed a Linux monitoring agent to aggregate system specific data and store it in RDBMS. The work of this agent consists of running a few bash scripts triggered by CRON scheduled jobs to gather system data. This data is then used to generate SQL statements to push it into a PSQL database running in a Docker container. Analyzing aggregated data can help identify insufflate usage of VMs resources.
  - name: "SQL"
    git_url: "/sql"
    description: This project is dedicated to practising SQL queries and contains 28 solved tasks. The difficulty range of tasks varies greatly, from simplest select all to triple joins.
  - name: "JDBC"
    git_url: "core_java/jdbc"
    description: This training project provides code samples for interacting with the PSQL database using JDBC PSQL driver external dependency managed by the Maven build automation tool.
  - name: "Grep"
    git_url: "core_java/grep"
    description: Grep is Java-based console application that replicates the functionality of the grep bash command using core Java features like StreamAPI, Regex and I/O, Maven as a build automation tool and Docker as a container virtualization platform. TDD approach was incorporated as a pillar of development that led to better unit test coverage.
  - name: "Trade App"
    git_url: "trade_app"
    description: The Trade project is a Java based Spring Boot application that allows users to interact with the trading market, specifically with shares through REST API. The app stores information on selected shares in the PSQL database, and Swagger was configured to make the interaction with API more convenient. Application was covered with unit and integration tests using such tools asJunit5, WireMock, Mockito, AssertJ.

    description: Fair is a server-client model application composed of several mini-games united by one storyline. The server part was built as a Spring Boot application with additional WEB and DATA modules to provide infrastructure for building REST API applications with communication with a database. To persist data back-end, part uses PostgreSQL for kipping long-termed necessary configuration data and Couchbase as a NoSQL database for keeping small game state data. The client was implemented on top of the JavaFX framework.
